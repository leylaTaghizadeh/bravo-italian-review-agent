      "So sorry to hear about your experience, John. Waiting 45 minutes with a reservation and then receiving cold pasta is absolutely not the standard we strive for here at Bravo Italian. We're a family business, and we take pride in our food and service, so this is very disappointing for us too. We're looking into this immediately to ensure it doesn't happen again. We hope you'll give us another chance to show you the true Bravo Italian experience.\n\nWarmly,\nMaria \u2013 Owner\nmaria@bravoitalian.co.uk | +44 20 7946 0860"
